    "Working with Jupyter is literally like writing a notebook. You can document your work, make it accessible to other people and easily reproduce it in the future. Once the notebook is set up, you can readily share it with others. For example, GitHub <a href=\"https://github.com/blog/1995-github-jupyter-notebooks-3\">natively renders</a> notebook files as soon as they are committed into a repository. Alternatively, you can export your notebook into a number of different formats, including PDF, HTML, Markdown, and reST.\n",
